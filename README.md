# Duality and Entanglement of two Qubits
This software allows one to compute entanglement, coherence and predictability in the case of a two-qubit quantum system, using the IBM Q quantum computer.

# Introduction
Since the early ages of quantum mechanics, wave-particle duality has been widely discussed. Through history, experiments have emphasized its extreme counter-intuitive aspects, making of it not only one of the most famous experiment, but sometimes referred to as the "most beautiful experiment in physics". Quantum entanglement, a key to the power of quantum computing, also skrikes our intuition, with non-local correlations. Theoretical developments recently pointed out that mechanisms responsible for the observation of wave-particle duality are closely related to entanglement. The IBM Q quantum computer is the ideal tool to experimentally verify this relation and investigate for the first time the fundamental quantum behaviour at the origin of multiple experiments. Indeed, the importance of this experiment is its strong generality, and it can indeed explain various experimental observations, especially in quantum optics.
